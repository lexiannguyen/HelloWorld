        I also visited Seoul in 2019 and I was there for about 5 days, and in those 5 days, we were able to fit in SO MUCH stuff.
         Mainly because we did this cool tour bus thing which is a popular way to get around the city. You basically pay for a card
        and these Seoul tour buses go around the city and you can ride on them like normal buses, but they take you to more touristy spots.
         The food is also really cool, though I did experience some racism(?) at a restaurant because the owners didn't like Americans and were 
        being .. difficult. Other than that, I had a lot of fun! There were lots of things to do since it's a city, and one of my favorite memories
        is buying a Melona from 7-11 at midnight and walking around the city.

        <td>Food</td>
        <td>Lots and lots of snacks! I stayed near Myeongdong and it was always busy with street vendors and younger people/older teens 
        buying food and hanging out. The food is pretty good everywhere, but the beef for kbbq is a lot more expensive than it is in the States.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Transport</td>
        <td>Pretty convenient, there's a card you can load, kind of like a credit card but you have to do it at a convenience store and you 
        can use it for transportation and in convenience stores. I recommend trying the Seoul tour buses that go around. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sightseeing/Activities</td>
        <td>There was so much to do, we were only there for a short time but it felt much longer because of all of the activities. Here are some places 
        we went to: Namsan Tower, Gyeongbokung Palace, Gangnam, Lotte Tower, Myeongdong, other night markets, Korean Folk Village, 
        Hondae and Insadong mall/market area.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hotel</td>
        <td>We stayed at Oriens Hotel and Residences, and it was a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom flat with a small kitchen, living room, balcony and washer/dryer. 
        It was conveniently located a short walk away from Myeongdong station and the night market.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Notes</td>
        <td>There's a 10 story Daiso building and for some reason I found that really cool. Also if you like kpop, you'll love it here 
        because there is literally no escaping the faces of idols in your everyday life. They're on billboards, buildings, lamposts,
         in metro stations, on buses, their music plays on speakers everywhere, people sell so much merch (and for some reason a lot of fake gucci and LV) 
        and they are even on coffee cups. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br></br>
    <p>
      Another cool thing we did was go to somewhere called the Korean Folk Village (i'm not really sure what it's called lol) where it's like 
      an actual traditional Korean village. There are dirt floors, traditional buildings, a few ponds, a river, a museum and even some livestock! 
      It was cool to see how people lived back then and I felt like I was on the set of a historical drama. Similar to Kyoto, there are also 
      stores that rent outfits to tourists right outside, along with a few restaurants with some really good cold noodles and kimchi. Back to the outfits, they're mainly 
      rented by women and girls, and they let you pick your top and skirt for your hanbok. There's a changing area, they can do your hair and even have a few 
      props and parasols. It was a really cool experience, though I did feel a bit poofy for the day.
