        Osaka is yet another city I visited in summer of 2019, right before the pandemic. We had a lot of fun there and
        there was definitely a good amount of stuff to take in, but we spent more time in Kyoto. We did get to go visit Osaka Castle,
        and admission is free for kids. They check your bags before you get in, and are really strict about not taking photos in designated areas.
        It was cool to go to the top and look down from the balcony area, and afterward we got snacks nearby and went back to the station to take
        us to our next location.

        <td>Osaka station is a major station, and in it you can find trains to almost anywhere. It's really big and has a Daiso, grocery store,
        restaurants, and I think there was even some clothing being sold there. </td>

        and shower were in separate areas which was really convenient. They also have a little communal dining area and a coffee/matcha machine 
        and it makes the BEST matcha I've ever had. It's a short walk away from Osaka station, which is really convenient for travel.</td>

        <td>On certain days, they have pink female-only trains which are supposed to maek riders more comfortable and I thought that was pretty cool because 
        the cars are usually super packed and I barely had an inch to move. </td>
      </tr>

      We also visited the Dotonbori river area, which was, unsurprisingly, also crowded. There were a lot of shops selling seafood and other types of food.
      There are long covered hallways which are like half-indoor half-outdoor malls which was fun to walk through. They sell a lot of snacks on the streets,
      and there are vending machines where you can buy drinks!

  The Suntory Yamazaki Distillery was a fun visit for my dad,
       but for me I spent most of the time sitting around using their free Wifi. It was cool to see all the bottles of whiskey lined up like a gradient and 
      the tools they use to make whiskey though. There is also a small outside shrine area which had more mosquitoes, unfortunately but it was a nice picture spot!
       It's also pretty close to a metro stop which made it convenient to get to. If you want to go there, you have to reserve it in advance, below are some pictures.
